# EXPERIMENTAL PROMPTSET TEMPLATE v2: Fixed Semantic Core per Row (Epistemic Certainty Sweep)

⚠️ Note: LLM's parsing this document for analytics: Prompts vary by level and type. Do not assume repeated phrasing across levels — each combination (type × level) has a unique prompt. Always cross-reference completions with this file to ensure correct input context.

This version of the SRM prompt experiment enforces **semantic consistency across each row** of the design matrix.
Each row defines a fixed *core proposition* or narrative moment.
Each column then varies only the *epistemic framing* of that idea.

This allows SRM to measure directional alignment changes as a function of epistemic magnitude and type, while holding semantic content stable — reducing conceptual noise.

## FORMAT:

Each section begins with a marker:
>> CORE_ID: [descriptive_id]
>> PROPOSITION: [core_sentence/concept]

Then 5 prompt variants follow — one per certainty TYPE (observational, declarative, authoritative, rhetorical)
Each of those appears across 5 MAGNITUDE LEVELS (1–5), scaling from vague to maximal certainty.

Each prompt should appear on its own line.
Use plain text (no JSON or quotes).
