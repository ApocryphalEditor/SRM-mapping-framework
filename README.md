# SRM Resonance Mapper  
*A framework for mapping the internal geometry of transformer representations using angular projection, neuron-level modulation, and epistemically structured prompt sets.*

---

## 🌀 What Is This?

**SRM Resonance Mapper** is a fully modular Python framework for conducting geometric interpretability experiments in transformer models. It builds on the original [Spotlight Resonance Method (SRM)](https://github.com/GeorgeBird1/Spotlight-Resonance-Method) proposed by Bird, extending it into a flexible system for:

- Capturing and projecting internal activation vectors
- Constructing 2D basis planes from prompt-derived contrast sets
- Running angular sweeps to detect directional resonance
- Modulating individual neurons during generation
- Visualizing results as Compass Roses, drift maps, and more

This repo includes both baseline SRM workflows and **targeted experimental extensions** that support hypothesis-driven neuron interrogation.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Spotlight Resonance**: Measures how many vectors fall within a directional "cone" as a probe vector sweeps around a plane.
- **Basis Planes**: Constructed from filtered prompt groups to define the semantic axes of projection.
- **SRM Analysis**: Projects all activation vectors into a basis plane and quantifies their angular alignment.
- **Intervention Capture**: Modifies specific neurons (e.g., clamps Neuron 373 to +10) during generation to observe representational shift.
- **Compass Rose Visualization**: Polar plots showing angular distribution of group alignments.

- Single-plane or ensemble basis generation  
- Exportable `.csv` and `.png` outputs for all SRM runs  
- Fully documented in `/docs` with step-by-step walkthroughs
